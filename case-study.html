      <br>
      
      <h2 class="case-text">This project was first built on the Server-Side. Through a RESTful API, which would pass the movies/director's information, to the front-side of the website.

  <h3 class="simplicity-left"><span class="black">Simplicity Breakdown:</span> An API is simply some software that sends information back and forward between a website/app and a user.<br><br>
  A REST API uses HTTP requests to receive, send, create, and delete data or files. In other words, via a REST API, a client is able to make changes to or access data from a database they otherwise don’t have access to. </h3>

    <h1 class="simplicity-center"><span class="black">Backend Goals</span></h1>
    <br>
    <h2 class="simplicity-left">
      <ul>
        <li class="simplicity-left">Install NodeJS with npm, and start building the project.</li>
      <li class="simplicity-left">Use Express to create API points, in order to obtain the movies data later in the frontend.</li>
      <li class="simplicity-left">CRUD implementation (Create, Read, Update, Delete), with Postman.</li>
      <li class="simplicity-left">Implementing a CORS policy. CORS allow us to recognize where the request are coming, and if they are coming from trustable sources.</li>
      <li class="simplicity-left">Password hashing, and Authentication with Passport Middleware.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="simplicity-center"><span class="black">Frontend/Client Goals</span></h1>
    <br>
    
    <h2 class="simplicity-left">
      <ul>
      <li class="simplicity-left">Choosing between Class or Functional components in React.</li>
      <li class="simplicity-left">Create low and high-level components, using React's lifecycle methods.</li>
      <li class="simplicity-left">Distinguish between Props and States.</li>
      <li  class="simplicity-left">Implement methods of authentication and form validation between views.</li>
      <li  class="simplicity-left">Redux implementation, Redux stores interaction logic for users.</li>

      <h1 class="simplicity-center"><span class="black">Biggest Challenges?</span></h1>
      <br>
      
      <h2 class="simplicity-left">
        <ul>
          <li class="simplicity-left">Initially the user-edit and registration areas were not working, the user would save it's personal info, the page would refresh, and no info would be saved.</li>
          <li class="simplicity-left">Some debugging was required, with Google Chrome DevTools and Visual Studio Code, my mentor also helped me a lot with this.</li>
          <li class="simplicity-left">For some time a CORS error message kept appearing on the Chrome DevTools when opening the website, it was just a function error on my code, that was found after a deep search.</li>
          <li class="simplicity-left">I've experienced some terminal related errors at the begining, on the backend side of the project, these errors were due to package updates, the errors were occuring mainly with Parcel.</li>
  

       
      </ul>

</div>

<div class="study-space">
      
  <h1 class="simplicity-center"><span class="black">Further Improvements</span></h1>
  <br>

  <h2 class="simplicity-left">
  <ul>
    <li class="simplicity-left">The website will go through some design changes, as I believe in continuous improvement.</li>
    <li class="simplicity-left">First-time users will receive a security code in their email, to make the registration process safer.</li>
    <li class="simplicity-left">Additional movies will be added in the future.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="study-space">
      
  <h1 class="simplicity-center"><span class="black">Conclusion</span></h1>
  <br>
  
  <h2 class="simplicity-left">Drive-In was the first website I've ever built, that related the backend with the client-side, which was challenging at the beginning. Even though, as I got deeper into the project, I would get more and more comfortable with it.</h2>
  <h2 class="simplicity-left">Apart from learning React, its quirks, and benefits, one of my favorite parts was using Postman, it is an incredible tool, where you can test all your requests, as if you were a user registering on the website, and make sure that these are functional. It worked as a perfect bridge between the backend and frontend.</h2>
  <br>
  <h2 class="simplicity-center-text">The excitement is real, I cannot wait to add more movies and directors to my website!</h2>
